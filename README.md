# Weather Feed for Ectomatter

The weather and warnings where you are, for screens that show them.

This is a plugin for [Ectomatter](https://github.com/Ectonomic/Ectomatter), one app for the devices on your desk. A plugin brings something into Ectomatter that isn't a device, such as another program, the games on the computer or the weather. It runs inside Ectomatter as a WebAssembly module and reaches only what its manifest (`core.json`) names.

## Adding it

In Ectomatter's Settings, under Plugins, choose **Add a plugin**, then pick Weather Feed and press **Add**. Ectomatter shows what the plugin can reach before you add it, and takes the package only if it matches the checksum in Ectonomic's list of reviewed packages, [ectomatter-packages](https://github.com/Ectonomic/ectomatter-packages).

## Building it

The plugin is built inside Ectomatter's repository, which links this one at `plugins/weather-feed` (a Git submodule) and holds what every package is built from: the library of the core protocol's names (`crates/ectomatter-protocol`) and the interface between a module and Ectomatter (`wit/core.wit`).

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Ectonomic/Ectomatter
cd Ectomatter
rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
tools/build-module.sh plugins/weather-feed/module/Cargo.toml plugins/weather-feed/core.wasm
```

Ectonomic builds its releases with Rust 1.98.1.

- `core.json`, `glyph.svg`: the plugin as Ectomatter installs it, its manifest and the files it carries
- `module/`: the module's source
- `crates/`: the plugin's own library, which its module is built from
  - `ectomatter-weather`: the weather now in one place, for every device Ectomatter drives: the Weather Feed plugin's library
