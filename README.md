# Weather Feed for Ectomatter

The weather and warnings where you are, for screens that show them.

This is a plugin for Ectomatter, one app for the devices on your desk. A plugin brings something into Ectomatter that isn't a device, such as another program, the games on the computer or the weather. It runs inside Ectomatter as a WebAssembly module and reaches only what its manifest (`plugins/weather-feed/core.json`) names.

## Adding it

In Ectomatter's Settings, under Plugins, choose **Add a plugin**, then pick Weather Feed and press **Add**. Ectomatter shows what the plugin can reach before you add it, and takes the package only if it matches the checksum in Ectonomic's list of reviewed packages, [ectomatter-packages](https://github.com/Ectonomic/ectomatter-packages).

## Building it

The folders are laid out as in Ectomatter's own repository. To build the module:

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
tools/build-module.sh plugins/weather-feed/module/Cargo.toml plugins/weather-feed/core.wasm
```

Each release's module is built from its tag this way, with Rust 1.98.1.

- `plugins/weather-feed/`: the plugin itself: its manifest, the files it carries, and its module's source (`module/`)
- `crates/`: the libraries the module is built from
  - `ectomatter-protocol`: the shared names and actions of Ectomatter's core protocol
  - `ectomatter-weather`: the weather now in one place, for every device Ectomatter drives: the Weather Feed plugin's library
- `wit/core.wit`: the interface between the module and Ectomatter
